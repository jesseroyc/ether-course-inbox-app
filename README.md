# ether-course-inbox-app
The following tech stack was used to build a rudementary ethereum blockchain:
    
  -asyncawait
  -ganache-cli
  -mocha
  -solc
  -web3
  
# Run the project
To run the project simply clone the repo
`git clone git@github.com:jesseroyc/ether-course-inbox-app.git`

There isn't much to see visually besides three mocha test clearing
`npm run test`

This blockchain made use of ganache for it's implementation

# Next Project
To see ganash ripped out and truffle used instead as a provider manager
